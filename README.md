# Decetreon

Introducing a revolutionary new way for developers to get rewarded for their contributions on GitHub - our platform offers a seamless, integrated solution that allows developers to find tasks with rewards, lock them for development, prove their work, and withdraw their reward.

Once a task has been chosen, the developer can "lock" it. As progress is made on the task, developers can add audit events to prove their work and show their progress. Once the task is completed, the work can be submitted for review and verification with Chainlink oracles, and rewards can be automatically released through a smart contract.

Our platform also ensures that the identity of developers is verified through GitHub, making it easy and secure to participate in the rewards program. 
Don't miss out on the opportunity to get rewarded for your contributions to open source projects on GitHub - connect your wallet to our platform today and start earning rewards for your hard work!
